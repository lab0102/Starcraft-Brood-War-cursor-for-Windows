# Starcraft Brood War cursor pack for Windows

I'm starting off with thanking to [CORVIAN](https://store.kde.org/u/corvian) for his [Starcraft Brood War cursor pack for Linux](https://store.kde.org/p/1680392)!

I converted to Windows cursor pack the the Starcraft Brood War cursor pack from CORVIAN meant for Linux.
As you can see, there are 2 folders:
- Starcraft Brood War cursor pack for Windows standard (31 items)

- Starcraft Brood War cursor pack for Windows extra large (37 items)

**_Starcraft Brood War cursor pack_** for Windows standard was only the pure conversion, where for **_Starcraft Brood War cursor pack for Windows extra large_** I resized/altered the cursors/animations to make them bigger/better suit the higher screen resolutions.
